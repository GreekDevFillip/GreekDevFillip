# Hi, I'm Filippos 👋

I'm a Mechanical Engineering student who writes code.
I work hands-on repairing ship engines at a machine shop,
and I build software tools that bridge the gap between
mechanical systems and programming.

## What I work with

**Engineering:** CAD (SolidWorks / AutoCAD) · Ship engine repair & maintenance

**Programming:** C++ · Python

## Projects
